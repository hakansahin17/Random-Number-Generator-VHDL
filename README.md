# Implementation of a Random Number Generator using Lagged Fibonacci Generator in VHDL

### Elec204 Digital Design - Term Project

This is the term project of the course "Elec 204 Digital Design" in Spring 2019 semester.

We implemented a random number generator using Linear Congruential Generator and Lagged Fibonacci Generator.

The code is written in *.vhd and the pins are decided on *.ucf files. You can run this project on a FPGA Board using the *.bit files.

This project was done on "Xilinx ISE" and in order to push our application into the FPGA Board, we used Prometheus.
